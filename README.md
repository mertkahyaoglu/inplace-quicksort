Inplace QuickSort
=================

Index l scans the sequence from left to right, and index r scans the sequence from right to left.
A swap is performed when l is at an element larger than the pivot and r is at an element smaller than the pivot.
A final swap with the pivot completes the divide step, then recursively calls the function.
